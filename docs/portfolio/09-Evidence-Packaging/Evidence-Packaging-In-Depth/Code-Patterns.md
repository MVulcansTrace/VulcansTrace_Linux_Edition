## Pattern 1 — Builder with Orchestrator-Only Logic

**Where:** [EvidenceBuilder.cs](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/EvidenceBuilder.cs)

The `EvidenceBuilder` contains no formatting logic. It orchestrates:

1. Call each formatter and include the raw log passthrough
2. Hash each content file
3. Assemble and sign the manifest
4. Pack into ZIP

This keeps the builder auditable — the entire integrity chain is visible in one file without interleaving presentation logic.

```csharp
var files = new Dictionary<string, byte[]>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
{
    ["findings.csv"]  = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_csvFormatter.ToCsv(result)),
    ["log.txt"]       = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(rawLog ?? string.Empty),
    ["report.html"]   = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_htmlFormatter.ToHtml(result)),
    ["summary.md"]    = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_markdownFormatter.ToMarkdown(result)),
    ["findings.json"] = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_jsonFormatter.Format(result, rawLog ?? string.Empty)),
    ["findings.stix.json"] = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_stixFormatter.Format(result, rawLog ?? string.Empty))
};
```

Every formatter implements `IEvidenceFormatter` with `Format`, `FileExtension`, and `ContentType`, ensuring a consistent contract for future formats.

## Pattern 2 — Output-Specific Escape then Encode

**Where:** [CsvFormatter.cs:60-80](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/Formatters/CsvFormatter.cs), [HtmlFormatter.cs](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/Formatters/HtmlFormatter.cs), [MarkdownFormatter.cs:80-96](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/Formatters/MarkdownFormatter.cs)

Each formatter applies defense in two stages:

1. **Sanitize** — neutralize format-specific injection vectors (formula characters in CSV, control characters in Markdown)
2. **Encode** — wrap the result in the format's quoting mechanism (double-quote escaping in CSV, `HtmlEncode` in HTML, backslash escaping in Markdown)

```csharp
// CsvFormatter — formula injection defense THEN CSV quoting
if (first == '=' || first == '+' || first == '-' || first == '@')
    sanitized = "'" + sanitized;
if (sanitized.Contains('"') || sanitized.Contains(','))
    return $"\"{sanitized.Replace("\"", "\"\"")}\"";
```

```csharp
// HtmlFormatter — encode every user content field
sb.AppendLine($"<td>{System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode(f.Category)}</td>");
```

```csharp
// MarkdownFormatter — escape special characters that break GFM tables
string[] specials = ["\\", "|", "*", "_", "`", "[", "]"];
foreach (var s in specials)
    sanitized = sanitized.Replace(s, $"\\{s}");
```

This two-stage approach ensures that injection defense is applied before structural encoding, preventing edge cases where encoding accidentally reintroduces dangerous content.

---

## Pattern 3 — Null-Coalescing at the Boundary

**Where:** [EvidenceBuilder.cs:111-119](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/EvidenceBuilder.cs)

The builder treats `null` raw log input as `string.Empty` at the point of use:

```csharp
["log.txt"]       = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(rawLog ?? string.Empty),
```

This pattern avoids `NullReferenceException` deep in the build pipeline without silently discarding information — the manifest records `length: 0` for an empty log, which is itself informative (the analysis was run without a log file).

---

## Pattern 4 — Crypto Delegation to IntegrityHasher

**Where:** [IntegrityHasher.cs](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Core/Security/IntegrityHasher.cs)

All cryptographic operations are encapsulated in `IntegrityHasher`:

```csharp
public byte[] ComputeSha256(byte[] data)
{
    using var sha = SHA256.Create();
    return sha.ComputeHash(data);
}

public byte[] ComputeHmacSha256(byte[] data, byte[] key)
{
    using var hmac = new HMACSHA256(key);
    return hmac.ComputeHash(data);
}
```

The builder never touches `SHA256` or `HMACSHA256` directly. This:

- Enables test-time mock injection to verify the builder uses the hasher correctly without computing real hashes
- Centralizes any future algorithm migration (e.g., SHA-256 → SHA-3) in a single file
- Makes the cryptographic boundary auditable — all hash/HMAC calls go through one class

---

## Pattern 5 — Deterministic Serialization

**Where:** [EvidenceBuilder.cs:124-136](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/EvidenceBuilder.cs)

The manifest is constructed from deterministically ordered data:

```csharp
foreach (var kvp in files.OrderBy(k => k.Key, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
```

The manifest JSON is serialized with `WriteIndented = true` using .NET's `System.Text.Json`, which produces consistent property ordering for anonymous types. Combined with alphabetical file sorting, this ensures that the manifest byte representation is reproducible for identical inputs, making the HMAC signature deterministic.

---

## Pattern 6 — Conditional STIX Object Creation

**Where:** [StixFormatter.cs:133-145](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/Formatters/StixFormatter.cs)

The STIX formatter adds the `malware` SDO only when the findings contain a `C2Channel` category:

```csharp
if (result.Findings.Any(f => f.Category.Equals("C2Channel", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))
{
    bundle.Objects.Add(new StixMalware { ... });
}
```

And the `observed-data` SDO is only created when at least one valid IP address exists:

```csharp
if (objectRefs.Count == 0)
    continue;
```

This prevents the bundle from containing empty or meaningless STIX objects that would fail TIP validation.

---

## Pattern 7 — Hex String Interoperability

**Where:** [EvidenceBuilder.cs:182](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Evidence/EvidenceBuilder.cs)

Both SHA-256 hashes and the HMAC are written as **lowercase hex strings**, not raw bytes:

```csharp
var hashHex = Convert.ToHexString(hash).ToLowerInvariant();
var hmacHex = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Convert.ToHexString(manifestHmac).ToLowerInvariant());
```

This ensures:

- The manifest is human-readable JSON (hex strings, not base64 or binary)
- The HMAC file is a plain-text file that can be verified with any hex-capable tool
- Cross-platform compatibility — hex strings have no encoding ambiguity

---

## Pattern 8 — Structured Test Verification

**Where:** [EvidenceBuilderTests.cs](../../../../VulcansTrace.Linux.Tests/Evidence/EvidenceBuilderTests.cs)

The end-to-end test verifies the complete integrity chain:

1. Build an archive from a known `AnalysisResult` and signing key
2. Open the ZIP and verify all 8 expected entries exist
3. Parse `manifest.json` and verify it lists all 6 content files with correct count
4. Re-compute the HMAC from the manifest bytes and signing key
5. Assert the recomputed HMAC matches `manifest.hmac`

This single test validates the entire Phase 2-5 pipeline in one assertion chain.

---

## Security Takeaways

- The orchestrator-only builder pattern keeps the integrity chain auditable — the hash-then-sign logic is in one file with no formatting distractions
- Two-stage output sanitization (sanitize then encode) prevents format-specific injection at every output boundary
- Crypto delegation to `IntegrityHasher` isolates algorithm choices and enables test-time verification of cryptographic behavior
- Deterministic serialization ensures that the HMAC signature is reproducible, supporting forensic corroboration
- Hex string output for all cryptographic artifacts ensures cross-platform, human-readable interoperability
